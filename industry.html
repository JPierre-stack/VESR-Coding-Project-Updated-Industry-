            <h2>About the Industry</h2>
            <p>The animation industry focuses on the production of smooth and clean animations to share to the public. Storyboards, concepts, and designs are brought to life with every kind of medium of animation. 3D, 2D, Stop Motion (etc) are just a few examples of animation. </p>



            <h2>My Role in the Organization</h2>
            <p>I work as a Technical and Data Support, responsible for organizing, managing, and securing data. This includes troubleshooting technical problems and ensuring that technical requirements are met so that artists can create content. </p>

            <h2>Ethical Issues</h2>
            <p>An ethical issue in this role could be maintaining confidentiality and securing highly valuable and sensitive production data.</p>

            <h2>Cybersecurity Issues</h2>
            <p>Two common cybersecurity issues in animation include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Theft of Intellectual Property: Hackers may steal this data to sell to competitors, getting leaked online, or distrubute for piracy which can result in financial losses, damage to reputation, and a loss of competitive advantage for the studio.</li>
                <li>Ransomeware Attacks: Attackers can encrypt a studio's critical data and systems then demand payment for their release. This can bring an entire production to a halt, causing massive disruptions, costly downtime, and possibly forcing the stuio to pay a large sum of money to regain access to files.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
            <p>To protect animation organizations, best practices include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regularly updating software and security patches to prevent vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Training staff on cybersecurity awareness, including recognizing phishing attempts and securing passwords.</li>
                <li>Using multi-factor authentication for systems containing sensitive information.</li>
                <li>Continous network monitoring with data and sensitive information, mostly projects.</li>
            </ul>
