                   <li>Creativity is something that most people lose as they grow up. It is a deep connection to imagination and the ability to generate ideas. It is also a way to adpat to change in your own way.</li>
                                <li>Growing up, I was considered to be a very creative kid. I was always making something with paper.  I was able to adapt to certain situations that I was put in as a kid. I still come up with ideas to this day. </li>
                                <li>Creativity is considered to be childish as you grow older. But to me, it shows that there is still a sense of childlike wonder in someone. </li>
                                <li>I learned that being creative is a trait that should not be taken for granted. I hope as I get older that I never lose my sense of creativity.</li> 
                  </ol> 
                    <style>

                            <h2>Consideration</h2>
                <style>
                    h3 {text-align:left
                    color darkgreen
                        
                      
                    }
                </style>
                <ol>
                    <li>Consideration is also another trait that people usually forget about. It is a value that I care about the most compared to the others.</li>
                        <li>Being considerate around others shows not only respect but also diginity. Consideration can be of use when emphasizing with others with respect and thoughtfulness.</li>
                        <li>Consideration is something that I value in my friends, family and other people that I meet. It became my value because I have a friend who was surprisingly considerate to me and how I live.</li> 
                        <li>During that time, consideration wasn't something that I was used to. People were not taking in account of how I felt about certain things. Somehow, I showed them consideration despite them disregarding me.</li>

                    <h2>Responsibilty</h2>
            <style>
                h2 {text-align: left
                    color darkgreen
                }
            </style>
            <ol>
                <li>Responsibilty is one of the many values that I respect the most.</li>
                    <li>Having a sense of responsibilty can go a long way in life. If you can show someone that you are responsible, the trust builds between each person you meet. It shows that people can depend on you given the opportunity. </li>
                    <li>Growing up, I had to learn the hard way about repsonsibilty. As a kid, I tended to lose a few things from time to time. (Losing as in just misplacing it under the bed.) But losing a video game really made me sit and think about it. If I were to lose anything else, then I would not get anything new from my parents. I also didn't want to lose another Nintendo game.</li>
                    <li>Responsibilty is a value that will continue to be one of the many core values that I have developed.</li>
            </ol>
                    <div> 
                        <h2>Trust</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Trust can be gained by those around you. Without it, it can cause some trouble for your family and friends.
                                <li>Someone who is trustworthy can have the ability to be transparent with others and be able to do something effectively.</li>
                                <li>It also shows a sense of care and empathy for others which can be an essential part of life.</li>
                                <li> Trust has been one of my main values since I was a kid. I never really trusted anyone during my childhood as I got older. Finding someone who I could trust became difficult. So it became something that I value the most when it comes to certain situations.</li>
                            </li>
